# likelihood-tools
Some code for setting up scans of arbitrary likelihood functions. Probably reinventing some wheels but this has proven as a good utility tool for my work. Feel free to use if you think this is useful for yourself.

## Installation
Just install via pip `pip install .`.

## How to use
Check out the demo notebook in `examples`. It showcases what you can do with this package with a very simple sinusoidal model.
